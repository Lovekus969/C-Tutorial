1. Variables in C

    A variable is a name given to a memory location that stores data.

Rules:

    Must start with a letter or underscore (_name, age ✅ but 1num ❌).
    Case-sensitive (Age ≠ age).
    Must be declared before use.

2. Leading underscore

C allows variables/functions starting with _, but Names beginning with _ followed by an uppercase letter or another _ are reserved for the implementation (compiler, standard library).

Example: _IO_FILE is used internally by < stdio.h>

So, as a best practice, don’t start your own identifiers with _, to avoid conflicts.

🔹 3. Used in unused variables

Sometimes programmers name variables _ to signal “ignore this”.
(Not standard in plain C, but common in C++/POSIX environments.)
